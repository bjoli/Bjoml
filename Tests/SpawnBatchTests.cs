/// Tests for the spawn batching in <c>SpawnBatch</c>.

/// Batching parks freshly spawned fibers in a thread-local buffer and hands them to
/// the pool in groups, which is a ~7x throughput win but introduces a failure mode
/// the unbatched path did not have: a fiber that is buffered but never published is
/// never run. Every test here is written so that a stranded fiber shows up as a
/// TIMEOUT rather than as a silently wrong number.
