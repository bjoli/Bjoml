/// Work dispatch for BjoML.
///
/// BjoML runs on the .NET thread pool rather than on dedicated worker threads.
/// The pool already implements per-thread local queues with work stealing, which is
/// exactly what the old <c>BlockingCollection</c>-per-worker design lacked: a fiber
/// that spawned 10 000 children pinned all of them to its own queue while every
/// other worker sat idle in <c>GetConsumingEnumerable()</c>.
///
/// Every enqueue goes through <see cref="ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem(IThreadPoolWorkItem, bool)"/>
/// with <c>preferLocal: true</c>, so work produced by a rendezvous lands on the
/// producing thread's local queue and is picked up without a global handoff, while
/// remaining stealable when that thread falls behind.
///
/// EXECUTION CONTEXT: nothing here ever captures or restores an
/// <see cref="ExecutionContext"/>. That is deliberate and load-bearing. The hosted
/// language carries its own dynamic environment (see <see cref="FiberContext"/>),
/// so flowing EC would be pure overhead *and* would reinstate ambient C# state on
/// top of the fiber's own. "Unsafe" in <c>UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem</c> means
/// precisely "do not flow EC", which is what we want on every path.
