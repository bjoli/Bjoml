/// <summary>
/// Amortises the .NET thread pool's per-work-item cost across a burst of spawns.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. Measurement (bench/Diag) on a 12C/24T Zen 4 box, 1e6 units:
///
///   Parallel.For chunked, no queue at all ............  11 ns/unit
///   one ThreadPool work item per unit ................ 185 ns/unit
///   one ThreadPool work item per 32 units ............  31 ns/unit
///   Bjo.Spawn (one work item per fiber) .............. 216 ns/unit
///   Bjo.Spawn with GC *entirely* disabled ............ 196 ns/unit
///
/// So a spawn costs ~216 ns of which ~20 ns is GC and ~185 ns is the queue. The
/// allocation is nearly free — a zero-allocation pre-allocated work item costs the
/// same 185 ns. What costs is the *number of queue operations*: 24 threads
/// contending on the pool's thread-request counter and stealing one item at a time.
/// Go is faster at spawning for exactly this reason: its run queues move work in
/// batches (half a queue per steal, 128 goroutines per global-queue spill) whereas
/// .NET's work-stealing queue moves one item per steal.
///
/// So we hand the pool BATCHES instead of items. One queue operation per
/// <see cref="Capacity"/> fibers instead of one per fiber.
///
/// THE HAZARD, AND WHY THE WATCHDOG IS NOT OPTIONAL. Parking fibers in a
/// thread-local buffer means they are not stealable, and — much worse — a thread
/// that spawns and then blocks on something *outside* BjoML (a Monitor, a
/// ManualResetEventSlim, Console.ReadLine) would strand them forever. That is a
/// deadlock, not a slowdown. Three things prevent it:
///
///   1. BURST DETECTION. The first <see cref="BurstThreshold"/> spawns in a run go
///      straight to the pool, so the overwhelmingly common "spawn one or two
///      children and await them" shape never touches the buffer at all and is
///      byte-for-byte the old behaviour.
///   2. FLUSH ON YIELD. Every work-item boundary flushes (see
///      <see cref="Scheduler.OnWorkItemComplete"/>), so a fiber that suspends or
///      returns publishes everything it queued.
///   3. WATCHDOG. Batches are registered globally and a 1 ms timer flushes any
///      that a thread is sitting on. This is the backstop that makes 1 and 2
///      optimisations rather than correctness requirements: even a thread that
///      spawns 5 fibers and then spins forever on a raw lock cannot strand them.
