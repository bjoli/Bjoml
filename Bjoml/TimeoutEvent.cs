/// dead because they are gated by a CAS on their own op's <see cref="SyncState"/>.

/// unconditionally when the branch loses. A recycled node's cancel delegate could
/// therefore be invoked by a PREVIOUS sync's losing nack and dispose the timer of
/// whatever the node is doing NOW. A fresh node per armed sync makes a late
/// cancel harmless: it hits this node's gate and finds it already Done.
///
/// The gate (<see cref="_gate"/>) is the single owner-election point: whichever
/// of Fire and Cancel exchanges it first is responsible for the timer; the loser
/// does nothing. Fire may also lose the COMMIT (the block was won between the
/// deadline and the CAS), in which case it just disposes; the nack that made it
/// lose has already run or will run, and both find the gate Done.
