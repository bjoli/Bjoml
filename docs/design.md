# BjoML runtime design

BjoML is a Concurrent ML implementation for a Scheme-like language that compiles to
C#. This document describes the runtime after the `IThreadPoolWorkItem` + `Fiber`
migration, and records what is deliberately *not* done yet.

## Scope: a compiler backend, not a CML library for C#

There used to be a second surface here — `Cml.SyncAsync`/`SyncAsyncVoid`,
`Channel<T>.GetMessage`/`PutMessage`, and the pooled `CmlValueTaskSource` behind
them — letting a plain `async Task` sync on an event. It is gone.

Everything the language emits goes through `Fiber` and awaits an `IEvent<T>`
directly, so that façade had no callers outside the benchmarks measuring it, and
its own doc comment recorded a leak it could not fix: a `ValueTask` created and
never awaited is never recycled. Deleting it also drops the
`Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool` package — its only user — and with it the
`CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies` workaround that existed to get that DLL next to the
probing path of a compiled program.

What remains of the interop surface is deliberate and small: `TaskInterop.FromTask`
(a `Task` coming in), `TaskInterop.Cancellable` (the withdrawable form the language
emits for `task->event`), and `TaskInterop.ToTask` — which has no callers, and is
kept because it is the only path for **.NET calling into Bjolang**.

This is reversible, but it means rewriting the pooled completion source if the
decision changes.

## 1. Scheduling

All work goes through
`ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem(IThreadPoolWorkItem, preferLocal: true)`.

There are no dedicated worker threads. The previous design gave each worker a
`BlockingCollection` and had `Enqueue` always target the *current* worker's queue,
which meant a fiber spawning N children pinned all N to one core with no way for idle
workers to steal them. The .NET pool already implements local queues with stealing,
so `preferLocal: true` keeps the producer-side locality while leaving the work
stealable.

Measured effect: a 480-child fan-out now runs 12–13x faster than serial on 12
physical cores. See `BENCHMARKS.md`. The cost is ~10% on the single-hot-chain ring
benchmark, where the old "never steal" behaviour was accidentally optimal.

### Inline dispatch

`Scheduler.Dispatch` runs a continuation on the completing thread when
`InlineDepth < Scheduler.MaxInlineDepth` (50), otherwise it queues. This is the fast
path and the common case: the thread that completes a rendezvous simply keeps going.

**`MaxInlineDepth` is load-bearing.** It is the only bound on stack growth for a
chain of continuations that each complete another rendezvous.

### ExecutionContext is never flowed

Nothing in the runtime captures or restores an `ExecutionContext`:

| Path | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| scheduler enqueue | `UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem` |
| fiber suspension | builder calls `awaiter.UnsafeOnCompleted` |
| `Task` bridging | `ConfigureAwait(false)` + `UnsafeOnCompleted`, never `ContinueWith` |

This is what makes it safe to enqueue work unsafely everywhere. The hosted language
carries its own dynamic environment (below), so flowing EC would cost an allocation
per await *and* layer C#'s ambient state on top of the fiber's own.

**Consequence:** `AsyncLocal` values set by C# libraries — `Activity`/OpenTelemetry
spans, some logging scopes — do not survive a BjoML await. If you want tracing, put
the span inside your own context object. This is asserted by the
`AsyncLocal does not survive a C# Task await` regression test.

---

## 2. The dynamic environment shim

`FiberContext.Current` is a single `[ThreadStatic] object?`. BjoML knows nothing
about the payload; the language owns it, so installing a context is one pointer
store.

The shim lives in the *builder*, because that is the only place that sees every
suspension point of a fiber:

- **at suspend** — `FiberCore.GetMoveNextAction` re-captures `FiberContext.Current`
  into the state machine box. Re-capturing every time (not just at box creation) is
  what makes a `(parameterize ...)` that spans an await work.
- **at resume** — `FiberStateMachineBox.Run` saves the ambient context, installs the
  fiber's, calls `MoveNext`, and restores in a `finally`.

The save/restore is not optional. Continuations run inline on whichever thread
completed the rendezvous, and that thread may be several frames deep inside a
*different* fiber. A resuming fiber borrows the thread and must hand it back exactly
as it found it.

`(parameterize ...)` compiles to `FiberContext.Push(...)` / `Dispose`.

**Limitation:** the context is only reinstated at *fiber* suspension points. A bare
callback handed to the scheduler from outside a fiber — a nack action, a promise
waiter — runs with whatever context the borrowed thread had. Such callbacks must
therefore never run user code; they should only wake a fiber. `TaskInterop.Cancellable`
respects this (its nack callback only cancels a token).

---

## 3. Fibers, promises and events

| Type | What it is | Language surface |
|---|---|---|
| `Fiber` / `Fiber<T>` | return type of a compiled bjoroutine; a compiler artifact | not first-class |
| `Promise<T>` | write-once cell that is **also** a persistent `IEvent` | first-class; what `spawn` returns |
| `IEvent<T>` | a CML event | first-class; what `sync` takes |

`Bjo.Spawn` returns a `Promise<T>`, not a `Fiber<T>`. That is the whole point: a
promise is composable with `choose`, which a `Task` can never be.

```csharp
var r = await Cml.Choose(
    Cml.Wrap(p.Join(),        x => "done"),
    Cml.Wrap(abort.Receive(), x => "aborted"));
```

`(sync ev)` compiles to `await ev` via `EventAwaitExtensions.GetAwaiter`. Nothing
else in the language suspends, which is what makes CML reasoning work: between two
syncs a fiber is atomic with respect to every other fiber.

### Errors are values

Events must never throw. An exception raised in an event continuation escapes into a
channel's matching loop and is swallowed by the scheduler's catch-all, leaving the
sync block hung forever. So failures travel as `Result<T>` and are only converted
back to exceptions inside a fiber, in an awaiter's `GetResult()`, where the state
machine turns them into `SetException`.

| Location | Throwing here is |
|---|---|
| inside a bjoroutine body | correct |
| inside an awaiter's `GetResult()` | correct |
| inside an `IEvent` continuation | **wrong** |
| inside a `Wrap` mapper | **wrong** (mappers run in the continuation) |
| inside a nack action | **wrong** |

### Task interop

`TaskInterop.Cancellable` is the only form that should be exposed for use in
`choose`. A plain `Task` is already running and cannot be withdrawn, so if a
sibling branch wins, an uncancellable task keeps burning a socket. `Cancellable`
wires a `withNack` to a `CancellationTokenSource` so losing the choose actually tears
the work down.

Both `Promise` and `Cancellable` events are **persistent**: once completed, syncing
again succeeds immediately with the same value. A completed promise in a `choose`
loop therefore wins every iteration and starves its siblings — the same trap as
`Cml.Always`. Document this for language users.

## 4. Bugs fixed in this pass

Each has a regression test in `Tests/`, and each test has been verified to fail when
the corresponding fix is reverted.

- **B1** — nack fired when the winner was a nested `choose` under the same
  `withNack`. Event ids are now a *tree*: `choose` mints children under the incoming
  id, `wrap`/`guard` pass it through, and a nack fires only if its id does not cover
  the winner.
- **B2** — two `withNack`s could share an id and the inner one silently overwrote the
  outer one's nack. Nacks are now a list, not a dictionary keyed by id.
- **B3** — a sync block could match *itself*, livelocking a whole thread forever with
  no exception and no diagnostic. `(choose (send ch v) (recv ch))` is legal CML and
  hung the process. Ops belonging to our own `SyncState` are now skipped and
  re-queued in a `finally` on every exit path.
- **B4** — `TryClaim` treated a transient `C` as "already lost", silently dropping
  completions that arrive from another thread. Added `SyncState.TryCommit`, which
  spins past `C` (safe: `C` is never held across user code).
- **B5** — `Scheduler.Start()` raced and could NRE on a partially-published array.
  Gone with the dedicated workers.
- **B6** — no work stealing. Gone with the dedicated workers.
- **B7** — a losing `choose` branch left its `PutOp`/`GetOp` parked in the channel,
  reclaimed only if some *later* operation happened to walk past it. A channel offered
  in a `choose` that then went quiet grew without bound: measured at exactly one
  stranded op per losing branch, 500 out of 500. Now bounded rather than driven to
  zero, by a park counter on the channel, at no measurable cost. See below.
- **B8** — `MarkSynchronized` was a public method that would stomp another thread's
  claim. Precondition now documented; self-committing events go through `TryCommit`.
- **B9** — the `ValueTask` path flowed `ExecutionContext`. Flag stripped at the
  time; the path itself has since been deleted along with the rest of the
  plain-C# façade.
- **B10** — root event id is now `0` and reserved; dead `Operation` helpers removed;
  operation pools are per-`T` statics rather than per-`Channel` instances;
  `withNack` no longer allocates a `Channel<Unit>` per publish.
- **B11** — `Promise.Complete` stored its value *before* claiming the cell, so a
  second, losing `TrySetResult` returned `false` — correctly — having already
  overwritten the winner's value on the way to finding out. Unobservable while
  every payload was a `Unit`. The hosted language's cancellation token carries a
  reason, and "cancelling twice is a no-op" has to mean the first reason is the
  one kept, so the claim now precedes the store.

Two bugs in the *proposed* code were also fixed: `TaskInterop.Cancellable` could not
compile (generic inference through an async lambda) and leaked its
`CancellationTokenSource` whenever the branch **won**; and `PromiseEvent` registered
waiters that were never removed when their branch lost.

### B7 in detail — count parks, not commits

The half of the fix that reads as a rewrite was already done, for unrelated reasons:
the channel had by then moved from `ConcurrentQueue` to intrusive lists under a
per-channel lock, and already had `CleanTakers`/`CleanGivers` to unlink and recycle
synchronized entries. Those were only ever called from the test-only `Pending*Count`
properties, so nothing in production ever ran them.

All that was missing was a trigger, and the cheap one is a **park counter on the
channel**. Every dead entry is necessarily preceded by a park in that same channel, so
counting parks bounds the dead set. `Channel<T>.NotePark` is called from the two park
sites with `_lock` already held, and sweeps once parks since the last sweep reach
`max(32, live * 2)` — which amortises the O(n) walk to O(1) per park. The fast path
pays one non-atomic increment.

**The guarantee is bounded, not zero.** A channel offered in exactly one choose and
then abandoned never parks again, so its single loser stays put. That is one entry per
abandoned channel, collectable with the channel itself. B7 was *unbounded* growth;
bounded is the fix. `Tests/CmlTests.cs` asserts this the only way it honestly can, by
checking that the residue does not grow with the workload: 500 and 4000 iterations
must leave the same small number stranded, and with the sweep disabled 4000 iterations
strand all 4000.

#### The expensive version, and why it is not here

The obvious design is to have the committing side drive cleanup: `SyncState` records
every channel a block parks in, and `MarkSynchronized` cleans each. It gives a strictly
stronger guarantee — zero stranded, including for the abandoned channel — and it was
implemented, measured, and removed. It cost **36 ns/op** on Select/Choose, roughly a
quarter of the whole operation.

Subtractive measurement, `bench/Diag --mode select --reps 25`, medians:

    baseline, no cleanup at all                      135 ns/op   40 B/op
    extra SyncState fields present, no registration  148         56
    registration, its lock removed                   167         56
    registration, cleanup body disabled              170         56
    full commit-driven version                       171         56
    park counter (current)                           132         40

Read that table before optimising anything here. **The lock is 4 ns and the cleanup
walk is 1 ns** — both were the author's stated suspects and both are noise, exactly as
in the `MarkSynchronized`/`NextEventId` investigation recorded above. The cost is the
registration machinery itself: two more reference fields on a per-`Cml.Sync`
allocation, the stores into them, and the interface dispatch to reach the channel.

Note also that the park counter is *faster than not fixing B7 at all* (132 against
135), because sweeping keeps the intrusive lists short and the matching loop therefore
walks fewer dead nodes.

Two hazards worth keeping, if anyone reinstates a commit-driven scheme:

- **Store the channel, not the operation.** A matcher can unlink and recycle an op at
  any moment, so a stored op reference may already belong to somebody else.
- **Clean outside the state lock.** Parking takes the channel lock and then the state
  lock, so cleaning while holding the state lock inverts that order and deadlocks.

A note on the old test. `characterise: losing branches accumulate in an idle channel`
could never have detected any of this: it read `PendingReceiveCount`, which calls
`CleanTakers()` *before* counting, so reading it performed the very reclamation the
test was meant to prove happened on its own. It passed with the bug fully present. The
replacement tests read `RawPendingReceiveCount`, which does not clean.

## 5. Known issues

### Channel ordering is not guaranteed

A contended operation is re-queued at the **tail**, so FIFO is not preserved and a
sender can be starved under sustained contention. Worth stating in the language
manual so the runtime is not held to FIFO later.

### Blocking bridge

`Bjo.RunToCompletion` blocks the calling thread. Do not call it from a thread-pool
thread: the fiber needs pool threads to make progress and you are holding one hostage.
